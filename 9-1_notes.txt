//int fork()

int p = fork()
// process id of child created
// child: p=0

if(p==0) {
	// I am the child - usually start another program
}

// everytime fork happens, everything inherited from parent

parent knows child, initially child doesn't know parent

	--PID is immutable until death
	--ps used to show tree-like structure
	- top = see what's up

Why fork? to start other processes
After fork, both parent and child are READY to run
